Meeting with Melissa

* Potentially getting involved in a different project - meet again on Thursday to start working on other stuff

* ~~Fix plot to get rid of the "night"~~

* Change legend axis for the epistasis plots

* Create .pdf of Col0

** Starting measured values of Col0 for each experiment

** Line plot showing how the measured values change throughout the day

** One example of a mutant that has a strange behavior among the experiments is mpk 16 for phi2. 3 line plots - one for each experiment - comparing mpk 16 and Col0. 

** ~~Prioritize fixing the p-value heat maps to not include the night, complete by 1/12/2021, December npq (fix both the data before quantile normalization and after - first, do the old data)~~

** December NPQ mpk 1-17
