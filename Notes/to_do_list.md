# January 12

* Finish README.md for the github repository. Include a description of each file in the repository.

* Why is the leaf area for January only plotting day 7?

* ~~Fix heat maps so the night isn't being plotted.~~

* Change all files names to read in the data from the new file path.

* Re-download the January data from the access database to make sure that the precision of the measured values and time points is correct.

* Message Siobhan about where to save big .txt files (maybe in the HPC?)

* A write-up of the steps for processing the data

* Modify p-value heat map to include the gray column

* Create .pdf of Col0

** Starting measured values of Col0 for each experiment

** Line plot showing how the measured values change throughout the day

** One example of a mutant that has a strange behavior among the experiments is mpk 16 for phi2. 3 line plots - one for each experiment - comparing mpk 16 and Col0.
